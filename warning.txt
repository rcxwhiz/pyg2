WARNING
DO NOT EXECUTE CODE ON YOUR MACHINE THAT YOU DO NOT TRUST

This program is meant to automate and simplify grading large amounts of Python code. Executing code that you have not
read is dangerous. This program has the following features built in to make it safer:
- phrase blacklist
	phrases that are not allowed to be present in source code
- package whitelist
	packages that are allowed to be imported
- function blacklist
	functions that are not allowed to be used in source code
These can be configured in the config file.

If you do not trust the code on your machine, you should read it before running it, or adjust the security settings in
the config. You are responsible for any damage caused by this program and any other programs it runs.
